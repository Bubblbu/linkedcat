> "Prominently indicate system status and users’ progress toward their goal."

- Improve loading screen
- Add information about the search term and what is being created

> "Guide users toward their goals."

> "Tell users explicitly and exactly what they need to know."

> "Minimize the number and complexity of settings."

> **"Let people use perception rather than calculation."**

- Argument against the usage of additional complex information such as networks/graphs

> "Make the system familiar."

> **"EXCESS COMPLEXITY DUE TO SEPARATE CONCEPTS BEING TOO SIMILAR"**

Complexity of adding different similarity measures for maps (citations, text similarity, altmetrics) 

Johnson also provides interesting guidelines for time units that matter (see Table 12.1 in Johnson, 2008). Examples are for instance 0.1 seconds for counting roughly 1-4 objects on screen (0.3 for more), >1 second can already qualify for progress indicators, 10 seconds is the typical time for a singular unit/task. _A complex decision should be decidable within 100 seconds._ (interesting evaluation -> is the map useful or not?)

- Use busy indicators
- Use progress indicators (better)

Guidelines:

- Show work remaining, not work completed. Bad: “3 files copied.” Good: “3 of 4 files copied.”
- Show total progress, not progress on the current step. Bad: “5 seconds left on this step.” Good: “15 seconds left.”
- To show the percentage of an operation that is complete, start at 1%, not 0%. Users worry if the bar stays at 0% for more han a second or two.
- Similarly, display 100% only very briefly at the end of an operation. If the progress bar stays at 100% for more than a second or two, users assume it’s wrong.
- Show smooth, linear progress, not erratic bursts of progress.
- Use human-scale precision, not computer precision. Bad: “240 seconds.” Good: “About 4 minutes.”

> Display important information first

Users prefer progressive results over a progress bar. Implication: Show results as soon as possible, even if remaining results and details only arrive progressively

> Work ahead

Exploit idle time to do processing. E.g., if the user loads a map already trigger map building for the main bubbles

> Monitor time compliance; decrease the quality of work to keep up

Meeting deadlines is important! Responsiveness in the case of animations and also loading times should be a priority in optimising tasks.
