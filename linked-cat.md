Open Knowledge Maps - A Cognitive Perspective

## Introduction

Provide a review of cognitive science literature in order to improve, question, and guide the development of the OKM interface.

Keep in mind that OKM is still a tool for **getting an overview**.

Why "cognitive"?
What is "cognitive"?
Which interface?

Some keywords: *Information Processing*, *Data Visualizations*, *Interface Design*

## Relevant Cognitive Science Theories & Topics

This study will investigate several questions around the way scientific knowledge and human cognition interact in the OKM interface. In order to explore and investigate the questions presented in this section we will investigate literature from several related fields and discpiplines.

### Moving beyond 100 articles

What is the current status quo of the number of items that humans are capable of keeping in their mind after the seminal piece in information processing *The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information* (Miller, 1956). Also questions around working memory and the map layout:

- Is the layered approach feasible and reasonable
- especially from a cognitive perspective
- Alternatives?
- Expert vs laymen?

What about the question of moving far beyond 100 articles? E.g., 1000-5000 items

### The experience of searching, exploring, and discovering

When is a search finished? Can or should we provide a notion of exhaustiveness?
What about the kind of topic and search? Queries might refer to:

- Research methods identified by keywords, established keywords
- Broader, and conceptually richer terms such as _mathematics_, _philosophy_, _algebra_

### Inequality and power dynamics within maps

Look into the [Open & Collaborative Science Manifesto](https://ocsdnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Open-Science-English.pdf) and especially data justice, cognitive injustice.

At what cost is the reduction of complexity and cognitive superiority coming that we are praising?

- Do we reproduce certain power dynamics from the system?
- Do we introduce some inequalities and negative effects ourselves within our interface?

Cognitive Injustice

- DOAJ suggestion to combat cognitive injustice: local peers and involvement
