Open Knowledge Maps - A Cognitive Perspective

## Introduction

Provide a review of cognitive science literature in order to improve, question, and guide the development of the OKM interface.

Keep in mind that OKM is still a tool for **getting an overview**.

Why "cognitive"?
What is "cognitive"?
Which interface?

Some keywords: *Information Processing*, *Data Visualizations*, *Interface Design*

## Topics

This study will investigate several questions around the way scientific knowledge and human cognition interact in the OKM interface. In order to explore and investigate the questions presented in this section we will investigate literature from several related fields and discpiplines.

### Cognitive Science

A broad review of contemporary cognitive science and HCI, data-viz, cognitive computing, and general software design theory.

### Working memory and the map layout

What is the current status quo of the number of items that humans are capable of keeping in their mind after the seminal piece in information processing *The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information* (Miller, 1956).

### Moving beyond 100 articles

- Is the layered approach feasible and reasonable
- especially from a cognitive perspective
- Alternatives?
- Expert vs laymen?

### The experience of searching, exploring, and discovering

When is a search finished? Can or should we provide a notion of exhaustiveness?

### Inequality and power dynamics within maps

Do we reproduce certain power dynamics from the system?
Do we introduce some inequalities and negative effects ourselves within our interface?
How can we counter those?
